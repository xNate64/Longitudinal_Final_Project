# Longitudinal_Final_Project

## This project uses SAS to analyze a longitudinal study that classifies children as "obese" or "not obese" using data from 3 visits for the child. Sex, obese status, and age were collected at each occasion. Sex, age at visit, and baseline age were the three covariates used to determine obese status.

### Data Description: "The MCRF study had the goal of examining the development and persistence of risk factors for coronary disease in children. In the MCRF study, weight and height measurements of five cohorts of children, initially aged 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, and 13-15 years, were obtained biennially from 1977 to 1981. Data were collected on 4856 boys and girls. On the basis of a comparison of their weight to age-gender specific norms, children were classified as obese or not obese."
